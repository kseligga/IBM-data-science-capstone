# IBM data science capstone project
For the last course for the IBM Data Science Certificate, I had an opportunity to create a capstone project in which we would predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The steps of the project, completed in Jupyter Notebook files, are as follows:
 - Collecting data from SpaceX API and webscraping
 - Data wrangling
 - Exploratory analysis using SQL
 - EDA with visualizations
 - Interactive dashboard in Dash
 - Machine learning predictions
